Semantic-Engine version 2.00
============================

Semantic Indexing Project

The Semantic Engine has emerged from an attempt to improve on standard keyword
searches. By analyzing the statistical patterns in natural language, 
concept-based relationships can be established between distinct texts that may
not share particular key words. By representing a text collection as a
graph-theoretic network, similarities and relationships can easily be found in
otherwise unstructured data.
